This project was constructed using ReactJS, Materialize CSS, Materialize React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  It is a web app that provides users with live availability information of the Dublin Bikes service. The user can sort the list of stations by name, search for a specific station and choose to only show stations with certain levels of availability. They can also view their chosen station on a map and identify whether payment services are available at their chosen station.

This application was built for the purposes of a college assignment and is currently hosted on [FireBase ](https://dbikes-react-1523440340962.firebaseapp.com/ "ReactDublinBikes").
